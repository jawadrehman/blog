## Flashback

Lets go back to 2012, I really wanted to create my personal website. Dabbling with HTML and CSS, I would keep on going until I realized what I thought was going to look like a _Mona Lisa_ was actually a _Frankenstien_.

So finally I think I am going to practice what I preach. Take one step at a time, and built it up.

## Purpose

I remember when I was starting out to code, I would get intimated. 5 years later, to build your website you are inundated with numerous tools / languages / frameworks and it can get overwhelming.

So when recently someone actually said they would buy a book on a "Javascript for Dummies" kinda book if I wrote it, it light a bulb within me.

Hopefully the bulb won't fuse out too soon :)
