## Is my computer broken ?

I am in the computer lab, learning how to create html pages. As part of the assignment, I am supposed to change the background colour on the page.

Around me I could see various colors all over the place, whereas I was stuck with the stnadard white. I tried changing colours, red / blue / green / magenta you name it. Nothing worked.

I thought my computer was broken or something. How was it possible that other collegues who would struggle in other computer assignments had pulled this off. Whilst still deep in that though, I reread my code and compared it with that in the book and found my error.

It was meant to be background-_color_ not background-_colour_

I was pretty annoyed at that time. How could you do work with stupid machines that didn't understand even correct English (U.S spellings are wrong just like the side they drive on).

Eventually I found myself back at the computer screen in university and when I did I asked the same question - _is my computer broken_ ?

## How I fixed my computer?

I started out by asking questions specially from people who actually knew what they were doing. As they would fix my code - I realised one thing, they didnt make too many changes. Just a small thing here, and a small thing there.

Eventually I managed to figure out how to fix the issues that I would end up in. Either by handy dandy Google or by tracing my way using logs and breakpoints.

## So ... can i code ?

Well, if you are good with Maths and enjoy puzzles, you should be able to get your head around it.

Generally speaking basic code revolves around two things -

#### Conditions

```
if (condition){
    //do stuff
}else{
    // do something else
}
```

#### Loops

```
while(condition){
    //do stuff
}
```

There are variations around them but the general concept remains the same.

Of course this is a really simplfied version. But the gist is if you think that being a software engineer is like dragging and droping things onto the screen, thats not entirely true - but that doesnt mean its any harder once you get used to it and all it requires is some patience and determination.
